(Gary W. Green/Getty Images)\n\u00a0\nShare\n0\nGeorge Zimmerman, the Florida man accused of second-degree murder for the death of Trayvon Martin, was given a major legal victory less than 48 hours before opening statements begin in his highly controversial trial.\nCircuit Judge Debra Nelson ruled today that prosecutors cannot bring two audio experts to the stand who claim they heard Martin screaming for help in 911 audio moments before he died. According to the court order, \"there is no evidence to establish that their scientific techniques have been tested and found reliable.\"\nThe ruling is a key boost to Zimmerman's defense that he shot and killed the unarmed teenager after a life and death struggle ensued in which the former neighborhood watch captain, not Martin, cried out for help.\nAs a result of the ruling, jurors will be able to hear the 911 call, but will have to decide for themselves who was screaming in the brief audio. Both witnesses are now banned from testifying in the trial that began two weeks ago with jury selection.\nRELATED: George Zimmerman's Lawyers Want 911 Call Played in Court\nThe judge's ruling came after several days of testimony in an unusual Frye court hearing during which Zimmerman's legal team called four witnesses to rebut the testimony of two state audio experts.\nAlan Reich and Tom Owens both claimed that after spending hundreds of hours listening to the 911 audio they could hear two voices.\nReich said Martin could be heard yelling \"I'm begging you\" and \"stop.\" He said Zimmerman could also be heard, but that he was not pleading for help.\nGary W.

To cover all those it takes 20 to 30 seconds.\"\n\"The 911 call is probably the best evidence of what happened that night besides George Zimmerman's testimony and Trayvon's,\" legal analyst Bill Schaefer said earlier, adding that of course Martin wouldn't be able to testify and explain his version of events.\nAn all-female jury was selected for the trial, which begins Monday with opening statements. Six jurors were chosen from a potential pool of hundreds over nine days. They will be sequestered for the length of the trial, which could last between two and four weeks.\nRELATED: Trayvon Martin Drug Photos Can't Be Mentioned, Says Judge\nProsecutors accuse Zimmerman of profiling Martin, a 17-year-old high school student who was staying in the Twin Lakes Retreat subdivision in Sanford while serving a suspension from a Miami high school. They allege Martin was walking through the gated community on his way back to the home of his father's girlfriend after leaving a convenience store when he was spotted and followed by Zimmerman.\nZimmerman admits to killing Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, but says he did so in self defense. When Zimmerman reported Martin to a non-emergency dispatcher he was told not to follow the teen and that they were sending a car. What happened next remains unclear.\nZimmerman claims that he did not follow the teen and that Martin confronted him and knocked him down. He claims Martin banged his head on the sidewalk several times and that the two struggled over Zimmerman's gun until he pulled the trigger.\nNelson ruled Friday that when opening statements begin, prosecutors will be able to tell the jury that Martin was profiled by Zimmerman, but that they should avoid characterizing the profiling as \"racial.\" They can also say Zimmerman was a \"wannabe cop,\" use the word \"vigilante\" and say that he confronted Martin.\nMore from ABC News", "James Gandolfini: A Look at His Final Hours\nBy GILLIAN MOHNEY\nJune 22, 2013\nJames Gandolfini attends the premiere of \"Cinema Verite\" at Paramount Theater, April 11, 2011, in Hollywood, Calif.

As we wait for the royal baby, we wonder... Who's on diaper duty? What will the baby eat? What will it call the queen?  ABC News royal contributor Victoria Murphy weighs in on some of our most burning questions.\nAlpha/Landov\nWill the royal baby have pets?\n\"Definitely,\" Murphy said. \"Pets are a really big deal in the royal household. They love animals, particularly dogs and, obviously, William and Kate already have a dog.\"\nThe royal baby will join its parents' dog, Lupo, a black cocker spaniel that has been known to join the couple for walks on the beach, strolls through the woods and even on the polo field.\nMurphy said both sides of the family are \"really keen\" on animals.\n\"I think that the child will be brought up in the same way and will, I'm sure, have a really lovely relationship with little Lupo,\" she said.\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\nWill the future king or queen learn to drive?\nJudging by dad, Uncle Harry and Great-grandmum's interests ... the answer is yes.\n\"William and Harry both drive helicopters as well as cars, so I think it will be important to them that their child does all of those things as well, the normal rites of passage of growing up,\" Murphy said. \"But, of course, they will also have access to the transport that William and Kate have, chauffeurs when they need them.\"\nBoth princes have piloted helicopters as part of their service in the Royal Air Force.\nAnd who can forget Prince William's breaking tradition by famously whisking away his new bride in a convertible Aston Martin after they royal wedding? It was decorated with streamers and balloons and a \"JU5T WED\" license plate. He knows how to drive and he might very well get it from his grandmother.\nQueen Elizabeth II, 87, has often been spotted cruising around the countryside in her Range Rover after a shooting session.\nGerber or gourmet? What will the young monarch eat?\n\"I think it will have a very normal diet,\" Murphy said. \"If you look back at William's childhood, there were quite a few instances where people have talked about him liking some very un-royal things like chocolate biscuit cake, which he had at his wedding, and bacon fried in the microwave.\"\nShe predicted the royal heir will be just like any other kid that craves sweets and chocolates, but will have a health-conscious mum to stay on track.\n\"Kate, particularly, is quite keen on being healthy so I think they'll be encouraging their child to develop healthy eating habits.\"\nSee photos from throughout Kate Middleton's pregnancy.\nWill the newest heir to the throne go to school?\n\"Absolutely,\" Murphy said. \"I think that's something that will be really important to William and Kate, that they make sure they give the child as much chance as possible to have a normal upbringing and to mix with other children. I think that is something that Diana very much paved the way for with William and Harry.\"\nWilliam and Harry both went to regular (albeit elite) schools with other children in London, and their mother made a point of allowing them to enjoy normal childhood experiences like amusement parks, the movies and McDonald's.\n\"I think, even more so, Will and Kate will want it to be like that because, obviously, Kate hasn't grown up with a royal upbringing at all,\" Murphy said. \"She mingled with lots of different types of people. She went to different schools and I think it'll be really, really important to her that her children have the opportunity to do the same.\"\nTim Graham/Getty Images\nWill the royal tot have a nanny?\nMurphy believes that while a nanny is an eventual must, Kate will try to be as hands-on as possible in the early days of being a new mother.\nKate will be taking a maternity leave from her royal duties but the length of time is undecided. William will take two weeks of paternity leave, according to royal sources.\n\"She will be a full -time mum and, I think, at that stage she will do it by herself, really,\" she said. \"I think it will be later on when she starts going back into doing royal duties. And when her timetable starts up again, I think they will, at that stage, look to get some help, absolutely. And it's an incredibly important job.\"\nMurphy predicted that the royal nanny eventually entrusted to care for Baby Cambridge will be someone older, with a lot of experience, who has been recommended to the royal parents by someone trusted.\n\"I don't think that they will give someone that job based on someone just popping in for an interview,\" she said with a laugh. \"They will need to know that the person has done the work before and done it really well, and knows exactly what they're doing.\"\nPrince William formed lasting relationships with the nannies that helped raise him. He cancelled a royal commitment in order to attend the October 2012 funeral of former nanny Olga Powell, with whom he was close.\n\"He actually broke off his attendance at an engagement to attend her funeral because of the significant part that she played in his life, so I think he will want to make sure that his child has somebody who they can form a strong bond with,\" Murphy said.\nFor diaper duty, will the royals opt for traditional cloth or convenient disposable?\nPrince William was reportedly the first royal baby to use disposable diapers instead of traditional cloth diapers, and Murphy predicts the new, young parents will make the same decision.\n\"I'd be pretty sure the baby will have disposable diapers rather than the cloth ones,\" she said. \"I think it will be ordinary nappies, the ones that most people's babies use.\n\"That's a sign of the changing times,\" she added. \"I think the royal family will, like any family, adapt with the times.\"\nPrincess Diana Archive/Getty Images\nHow will we know the royal baby has arrived?\nThe first announcement from the palace will come when Kate has been admitted to the hospital, according to royal sources. It is understood that Kate will give birth in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Diana had William and Harry.\nThe formal birth announcement will come after the queen, royal family and Middletons have heard the good news, royal sources say.\nIt will follow the royal tradition of posting a paper announcement on an easel on the railing outside Buckingham Palace. The announcement will include the baby's gender, weight and time of birth. Kate and William have chosen to be surprised and do not know the sex of the baby, according to royal sources.\nThis old-fashioned announcement will be accompanied by a few more modern methods.\n\"The royal family has certain traditions that it comes back to time and time again, and I think the announcement of a new heir, I think, is going to be respected in the same way that it has been throughout history,\" Murphy said. \"But I also think they will utilize things like Twitter, social media and the website as well.\"\nPrince William was the first royal heir to be born in a hospital instead of in the palace. The first sighting of him and Prince Harry was when their parents exited the hospital with the new princes in tow. William and Kate are expected to do the same with their new arrival.\n\"I think that there will definitely be an opportunity for the baby to be photographed, assuming all is well once the couple leaves the hospital,\" Murphy said. \"I think that's the first time that we'll get to see him or her.\"\nIt's unknown when the baby's name will be revealed. Harry's name was announced the day he left the hospital, but several days passed before William's name was made public.\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\nWhat will Baby Cambridge call the queen?\nNo surprises here.\n\"As far as the queen goes, I think it will be great-grandma. That's what everyone would expect,\" Murphy said. \"That's what Peter Phillips' children, who are the queen's great-grandchildren, call her.\"\nMurphy predicted the child will use \"mummy and dad\" for Kate and William and \"grandpa or granddad and grandma\" for Prince Charles and Kate's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. No word on what step-grandma Camilla will be called.\n\"In many ways, they can be more formal but, certainly, when they're hanging out together and spending time together, it will be the usual things any family would use,\" Murphy said.\nWhat will the baby's title be?\nThe newest royal will be born with the title His or Her Royal Highness, as well as prince or princess.\nEarlier this year, the queen issued a Letters Patent, a decree method that does not require Parliament's involvement, to guarantee the title of prince or princess to all of William and Kate's future children.\nA previous decree that had been in place since 1917 said that a son would be a prince, but a daughter would not be a princess. She would be a lady.\nThis is separate from the recent British Parliament change to a 300-year-old law to allow William and Kate's firstborn, regardless of gender, to be heir to the throne. Queen Elizabeth II was only eligible to be monarch because her father had no male children.\nNo doubt the baby will also develop nicknames like its parents, Kate for Catherine and Wills for William.\n\"I think people will call it Baby Cambridge, colloquially,\" Murphy said.", "George Zimmerman Judge Denies Use of State Audio Experts' Testimony\nBy SENI TIENABESO ( @seniABC )\nSANFORD, Fla., June 22, 2013\nGeorge Zimmerman listens as his defense counsel Mark O'Mara questions potential jurors for his trial in Seminole circuit court, June 20, 2013 in Sanford, Fla.

Police reviewed surveillance video Wednesday that was taken at that club.\nPolice are also investigating \"other incidents of violence\" that Hernandez is suspected of being involved in, two sources told ABC News.\nHernandez is being sued by a former friend who lost his eye after he claims the Patriots player shot him in the face in February.

Babies born with this condition in the United States typically undergo three operations to work around the problem and allow the heart to do what it needs to do despite its problems, said Dr. Ralph Mosca, a congenital heart surgeon at NYU Langone Hospital.\nSometimes, however, the workaround doesn't work, and patients need a transplant, said Dr. Brett Mettler, a cardiac surgeon and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee who has not treated Teresa.  He said the percentage of patients who need this is unclear, but estimated it at about 10 to 15 percent.\nIn Teresa's case, she never even had the surgeries. Instead, she had one surgery in china to put a band around her pulmonary artery.\n\"She has defied all medical odds to survive this long without any intervention,\" Bartlinski said.\nWhen the Bartlinskis adopted Teresa \u2013 their fifth adopted child from China with special needs \u2013 they knew she was very sick and needed a heart transplant.

At the same time, we never gave up hope.\"\nIt's been almost three years since Teresa was brought from China, and she survived with the help of her doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  Even though other doctors told the Bartlinskis to take Teresa home to die, the Children's Hospital doctors gave her a drug that strengthened her lungs over time, making a lung transplant unnecessary.

But for the next nine months he will be struggling just to walk. When he leaves the hospital he hopes to walk out a new man, or at least one that is over three inches taller.\nJohn has elected to undergo a controversial and painful procedure because he wants to be taller. His legs will remain broken on purpose for up to four months while doctors work to lengthen the bones. Then John will have to spend another four to five months recuperating in the hospital. He will essentially have to learn to walk again.\n\"Right now I feel good,\" he said by phone 10 days after doctors broke his legs to begin the process.\n\"The first few days were pretty bad,\" he admitted. \"Now it hurts, but it's tolerable.\"\nJohn traveled thousands of miles from his home in New York to the Center for Anthropometrical (Orthopedical) Cosmetology and Correction in the Russian city of Volgograd for the surgery. He's one of a small, but apparently growing, number of medical tourists traveling to Russia for this procedure, which is banned in some countries and both rare and costly in the United States.\nJohn (not his real name, which he asked not be revealed because he hasn't told anyone but his mother what he is doing) can now walk slowly with a walker although his lower leg is swollen to about \"double\" its normal size. But his biggest obstacle has been inside his own head.\n\"You become handicapped from day to night, so that's also a challenge psychologically,\" he said. \"You start doubting what you are doing.\"\n\"I was a normal person, completely healthy. There was no reason to do this. So these thoughts get into your head,\" he said.\nJohn is currently 5-foot-5 and wants to add 8.5 centimeters, or about 3.3 inches, to his height. (The longest length the center has been able to add is nine to ten centimeters) It means he will have to be in the hospital for eight to nine months, three to four for lengthening and then another four to five for healing.\n\"Since I was 14 to 25 years old I really wanted to be taller. I wasn't happy with my height,\" he said. After turning 25, John became more comfortable with his body, but always wondered what it would like to be taller. He opted to have the surgery because he said he did not want to regret missing the chance.\n\"I was a very happy person, but I always wanted to be taller,\" he said.\nThe surgery is not for the faint of heart.\nIt involves strategically breaking the tibia, or shinbone, and then slowly separating the ends of the broken bone over a long period of time. As the body tries to heal the break by creating new bone, the fracture is extended yet again and the body creates even more bone in the gap.\nDoctors extend the fracture by a tiny amount several times a day, only a millimeter total each day, until the desired length is reached. The trick is to do it slow enough so that new bone continues to grow, but fast enough that it does not heal entirely.\nThe procedure was pioneered by Soviet Prof. Gavriil Ilizarov in 1951 as a way to treat World War II veterans with leg injuries. Recently the technique attracted attention from the Pentagon, which is funding a study into its use for leg trauma wounds. It has also been commonly used to treat leg deformities, like bowed legs. But in recent years it has also become a popular cosmetic choice for those, like John, who always dreamed of being taller.\n1", "June 22, 2013\nJewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\nWe didn't know that the White House promise of transparency would extend to presidential outerwear, so that Berlin speech wasn't a total loss.

Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\nMass. Appeal\nVoters are voting in Massachusetts on Tuesday, in the special election to fill the seat once held by Secretary of State John Kerry. Republicans have loved the biography of their candidate, Gabriel Gomez, more than they've shown love for his actual candidacy. National GOP donors have proven unwilling or unable to match the outside support on the Democratic side. That leaves veteran Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the prohibitive front-runner, and a Gomez victory would be a genuine and total shock at this point. That would mean a Democrat continuing to represent the heavily Democratic state, shattering hopes of another Scott Brown-style upset. But if the race is closer than the double-digit margin polls have shown, expect plenty of regrets to emanate from the Bay State about what could have been if national Republicans went all-in for the political newcomer with Latino roots and a central-casting resume.\nTony Avelar/AP Photo\nAfrican Skies\nThe first African-American U.S. president makes his first major trip to Africa as president, landing Wednesday for a trip meant to signal American reengagement with the continent. President Obama will visit Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania on the weeklong journey.

Things look good for a 70-plus vote in the Senate, with a vote expected Monday on a tighter (and quite expensive) border-security package negotiated to attract Republican support. In the House, though, efforts to include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants suffered a series of setbacks, most notably with House Speaker John Boehner's pledge to only permit a vote for a bill that a majority of Republicans supports. That puts more pressure on senators to deliver an overwhelming margin of victory for a bill. Thus far, the hard-to-read actions of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., appear to be paying off: Fox News host Bill O'Reilly signed on to the Gang of 8 bill this past week, giving conservative supporters a big measure of cover.\nGetty Images\nHut, Hut, Hike\nInterest rates on student loans will double July 1, if Congress doesn't act.

The limited attention span, restlessness, and distractibility that are hallmarks of the condition can hamper focus and productivity at work.\nMedication can help, but there are also do-it-yourself tricks that can help maximize productivity and efficiency. Read on to see how you can excel in your career.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nPrioritize tasks\nYou can improve your focus by tackling the big jobs first and leaving the small stuff till later. Make a list of what tasks are the most important. Your \"A List\" might include anything with a deadline of today or tomorrow. The \"B List\" would consist of projects needing to be completed next week, while the \"C List\" catches loose ends like checking your email.\n\"If you fail to prioritize tasks, this can lead to organizational and distractibility issues,\" says Simon Rego, PsyD, director of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Training Program at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nCorral Your Email\nEven the most focused individuals can quickly be led astray by the incessant ping-ping-ping of incoming emails. But if a person is already prone to distraction, these incoming signals can derail the whole day. Rather than read email as it comes in all day and night, set aside specific periods of time to do this.\n\"Most patients find this very useful because we're almost slaves to always having to be available to emails and phone calls,\" says David Loewenstein, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nLimit Other Distractions\nPersistent voice mails, the 24/7 availability of the Internet, and even casual conversations outside your office can drive you to distraction and away from the work at hand. As with emails, set aside specific times to check and answer voice mail messages.\nAnd depending upon what project is the most pressing, you may even consider turning off your computer to eliminate the endless allure of the world wide web. \"If you don't turn your computer on, you don't get distracted,\" Rego says.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nBreak It Into Bite-Size Chunks\nIf you feel yourself becoming overwhelmed, this may well be because you're taking on too much at one time.\n\"If you feel stressed or anxious, you can assume whatever task is making you feel (this way) is too big,\" Rego says. \"Therefore smash it into smaller, more manageable bits.\" If you're anxious about needing to write something before the end of the week, break it down so that you feel more focused. Set realistic goals one day at a time or even one hour at a time.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nWork in the Same Location\nWorking at Starbuck's one day, the library another, and your home office yet another will make you super-vulnerable to distracting external stimuli, says Rego. But if you habituate yourself to one place, your mind gets used to the area and can rev up to actually make you want to work.\n\"Being consistent in your environment and trying to work in the same place at the same time increases your natural tendency to do work in that area,\" Rego says.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nFind a Quiet Place to Work\nThe ideal would be to have a private office with a door but this isn't always realistic in today's world of Dilbert-like cubicles. If your boss isn't open to giving you your own office, there are ways to minimize distractions even in a small cubicle.\nIf you have to share your space, try to share it with someone who does more computer work than phone work and ask he or she to conduct meetings in other, more open spaces.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nSet a Timer\nSetting a timer to go off at certain intervals can help bring a wandering mind back to the task at hand.\n\"Have it go off as a cue to ask, 'Is what I'm doing right now one of my important A-List items? Am I on task?'\" says Rego.\nIf you're off task, this is a reminder to get back to what you were doing. You can also use a timer to try to gradually extend your attention span, from 10 minutes one week to 12 the next and 14 the next.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nDeclutter Your Work Space\nHaving a neat, clean work space can help improve organization and focus, but be aware that moving items around on your desk can be a double-edged sword. When cleaning your desk suddenly becomes a priority even with other deadlines looming, that could mean trouble.\n\"If all of a sudden it's so important to clean (your) desk, that could be a red herring,\" says Rego. \"Call it for what it is. . . Be honest with yourself. What is the function of what (you're) doing right now.\"\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nPlan Your Days\nMany people with ADHD find they are more efficient and productive if they use a day planner or a personal digital assistant (PDA). A compact PDA is especially useful because it can be carried with you and programmed to send messages and reminders, perhaps a 30-minute \"warning\" bell before an upcoming meeting.\nThat way you can make sure you're prepared and on time. \"You will always have cues that will orient you,\" Loewenstein says.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nUse Relaxation Techniques\n\"If you have ADHD and are impulsive or distracted, that can become even greater if you are under stress,\" says Loewenstein. That's why it's so important to take breaks where you can relax, be it just deep breathing, meditation or working with imagery.\n\"These things will help get people into a very focused state,\" says Loewenstein. This way, you can get a sense that everything is not equally urgent and take the time to reassess. Do you need to finish this job now or can it wait? \"It gives people a chance to recalibrate,\" he says.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nTake Notes\nTaking notes in a meeting or while you're on the phone can help you remember items later. You can also use the notes to highlight new items for your A, B and C lists. And there's another advantage.\n\"If you have problems processing auditory information in a meeting and become distracted, taking notes is great because you're processing in another modality,\" says Loewenstein.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nMaintain a Routine\n\"In general, anything that you can routinize that you know you have to do and it becomes overlearned is very, very good,\" Loewenstein says. If \"you're constantly losing things, that just puts added pressure on your life.\"\nThis could be something as simple as putting your house and car keys in the same place every day so you don't screw up your whole day. \"That's one less thing that can go wrong,\" says Loewenstein. The same goes for your organizer, notebooks, pens and briefcase.\nWays to Stay Focused at Work\nSurround Yourself With Organized People\nMany successful people with ADHD have one thing in common: They've set up the right supports. That means getting really \"together\" people around you.\n\"If you're a businessperson, you have to make sure you're surrounding yourself with people who are really well organized and who like to organize the day,\" says Loewenstein. \"Getting the right people around you, particularly if you're in an executive position, is absolutely invaluable.\"", "Share\n0\nThose  heading on a camping trip this summer might want to be just as wary of crossing paths with the wrong bacteria as they would a hungry bear.\nAfter 200 park employees and visitors reported bouts of gastrointestinal illness at Yellowstone National Park and nearby Grand Teton National Park this month, national park officials have warned visitors to be vigilant about hygiene.\nThe outbreak started on June 7, when a group touring the Mammoth Hot Springs complained of stomach flu and other gastrointestinal problems. After the tour group members reported their illnesses, about other 50 visitors and 150 park employees reported similar symptoms.\nPreliminary reports found that they had norovirus, or \"stomach flu,\" which affects up to 21 million people, every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDoctors Warn of New Stomach 'Superbug' Hitting U.S.\nAl Mash, spokesman for Yellowstone National Park, said campers who were worried about the outbreak should take care to properly store their food and wash  their hands with soap and water before eating.   \"Don't rely on hand sanitizer. It's good for a while if you don't have access to water,\" said Mash. \"But sanitizer is a poor second to washing your hands.\"\nAccording to the CDC, the norovirus can be very contagious and is usually passed from contaminated surfaces or food.\nGetty Images\nSearching for Grizzly Bears Watch Video\nMash said that while it might be more difficult to wash hands before and after meals on camping trips, sporting goods stores sell soap slivers or biodegradable soap that can be used on camping trips.  \"My manta is be aware but not afraid,\" said Mash.\nEmployees at Yellowstone and nearby Grand Teton park have been cleaning and disinfecting the areas where the illnesses were first reported. Yellowstone National Park regularly has 20,000 visitors a day.\nThe norovirus outbreak is just the latest one to hit the national parks. Last year, Yosemite National Park experienced an outbreak of the deadly hantavirus. Infection with hantavirus, often contracted through contact with contaminated mouse feces or urine, can lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can be fatal, according to the CDC.\nFor Hantavirus Survivors, Yosemite a Painful Reminder\nDuring last summer's outbreak, eight people were sickened and three died. To stop the spread of disease the National Park Service tore down the buildings where the outbreak was centered and are currently trapping and testing mice for the hantavirus.\nKathy Kupper, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said if campers were worried about becoming sick they should be sure to check in with the park's website or information line before they arrive. Any potential hazards from disease outbreaks from high concentrations of ticks, for example, will be listed in each national park's newsletter or on its website.\n\"Always pay attention to the information. Don't just take the [informational pamphlet] and throw it in the glove box,\" said Kupper.\nKupper said the one piece of camping safety advice, which is most often forgotten, is to stay put if lost.\n\"Otherwise it's like a wild goose chase,\" said Kupper. \"Stop moving. That way you're conserving energy, and rescuers have a better chance to find you.\"\nMore from ABC News", "Share\n0\nLife insurance for the dead? In a plot that might have been conceived by Fred MacMurray and George A. Romero , the nation's leading insurance companies continued billing customers for life insurance long after they were dead.\nThe companies--including such household names as AIG, Hartford, John Hancock, Met Life, Prudential, Transamerica and TIAA-CREF-- have agreed to a multi-state settlement under which they will repay some $763 million owed the heirs of the deceased.\nPrime mover in the settlement has been Controller John Chiang of the State of California, whose citizens stand to get back as much as $87 million from 11 insurers.\nCalifornia law requires a life insurer to pay death benefits to heirs within three years after the demise of the policyholder.\nTo keep tabs on which holders are alive and which are dead, insurers keep a so-called Death Master file, based on Social Security data.

Most policies, however, put the onus on the beneficiary to file a claim for benefits, after the policy holder's death.

It is a positive outcome for all concerned.\" The vast majority of claims, says ACLI, are paid promptly in the normal course of business.\nABC News asked for further comment from several of the 11 companies but received a response only from ING, whose statement says in part:\n\"ING U.S. is pleased to have reached an agreement.

If it's a clear night (or day), take a step outside for the largest full moon that you'll see until August 2014.\nBut wait, why isn't there a supermoon more often? After all, the moon orbits Earth every month. If the moon is at its closest point now, it should be at the closest point next month too. Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd at earthsky.org write that the supermoon's coming only once a year depends on how \"month\" is defined.\nIf you're watching the moon change phases from full to new and back to full again, you're dealing with the synodic month. The phase of the moon is determined by its position relative to Earth and the sun. If Earth is sandwiched directly between the moon and the sun, you get a full moon. The synodic month is a little more than 29 days long.\nCameron Spencer/Getty Images\nSupermoon vs. Blue Moon: Photos of Blue Moons Around the World\nIf you're on the moon and are recording how long it takes to make one revolution around Earth, you're dealing with the anomalistic month. Since Earth isn't in the exact center of the moon's elliptical orbit, there is a point at which the moon is at its farthest point from Earth (the apogee) and a point at which it's at its closest point (the perigee). The anomalistic month is a little more than 27 days along.\nThat two-day difference causes the two different types of months to be out of sync. For this weekend's moon, the full moon happens to coincide with the moon's perigee, resulting in the supermoon. Similarly, there will be times when the full moon occurs at the moon's apogee, where it will look smaller than usual.\n\"Smaller than usual\" isn't actually that different, though. According to space.com , there's only a 12 percent difference in distance between the moon's perigee and apogee.\nBut If you want to snap your own photo of a gigantic moon, try doing so close to sunrise. The moon hasn't magically grown in size, but it will be near the horizon. You'll see it looming over trees and buildings, which will make it appear bigger to our own eyes.\nEditor's Note: A previous version of his story misstated the positioning of the moon in a full moon. The story has been corrected to read if the Earth is sandwiched directly between the moon and the sun, you get a full moon.\nMore from ABC News", "Share\n0\nIf you own an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S, a free iPhone 5 is just a car ride away for the next week.\nOn June 1, Best Buy offered a one-day deal: bring in your old iPhone 4 or 4s and trade it for a brand new iPhone 5. The offer was so successful, that the retailer has decided to give it another, longer run.\nFor the next nine days, you will be able to bring in those iPhone models and trade them in for the newest Apple phone. The offer ends Saturday, June 29.\n\"We're seeing increasing interest from our customers and within the consumer electronics industry when it comes to trade-in,\" Best Buy said in a statement. \"Many consumers don't know they can trade in their old stuff and get a gift card to put toward upgrading to the latest and greatest in technology.\" Best Buy offers a trade-in program for other electronics and smartphones as well.\nThe free phone deal is a result of two ongoing promotions happening at Best Buy right now. In May, the store began offering any iPhone with a two-year contract for $50 off, bringing the iPhone 5's usual $199.99 price down to $149.99.  Now when a customer brings in an iPhone 4 or 4S they will get a $150 trade-in credit, making the iPhone 5 free.\nBut there are some caveats. Customers have to be eligible for an upgrade at Verizon, AT&T and Sprint (no T-Mobile) to get the offer and they will have to pay the carrier activation fees and sales tax.  The credit can't be used towards a different phone and the deal is only offered at physical Best Buy or Best Buy Mobile locations.\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\niPhone 5 Video Review Watch Video\niPhone 5: Top 5 Features Watch Video\niPhone 5 Rumor and Release Guide Watch Video\nThe trade-in device has to be in working condition to get the deal. Phones that are broken or cracked will not be eligible.\nGazelle, a consumer electronics trade-in website, does accept broken phones, however. \"Gazelle also offers up to $100 cash for broken iPhone 4 and 4S models, which is not an option with the Best Buy promotion,\" Gazelle CEO Israel Ganot told ABC News.\nHowever, Best Buy does say that if a customer's iPhone 4 or 4S is worth more than the $149.99 price of the iPhone 5, they will \"receive the positive difference in the form of a Best Buy gift card in addition to a free iPhone 5.\"\nSo what happens to your trade-in? Best Buy says the phones will be recycled or refurbished and sold through secondary channels. Before customers trade in phones, they should be sure to reset the device back to factory settings.\nPhone trade-ins have become a booming business as users look to upgrade every year or two.  Gazelle has built a $100 million business on Apple product trade-ins. Prior to the launch of the iPhone 5, the site received 1.2 million price quotes for iPhones from people who were considering selling their phones ahead of the launch.\nDo you Even Want an iPhone 5? Our iPhone 5 Review\nApple itself is said to be planning its own iPhone trade-in program . Bloomberg News reported early this month that Apple will launch a program in partnership with Brightstar, a mobile phone distributor. The service would allow iPhone owners to trade in their phones for a discount on new phones.\nApple may launch a new iPhone \u2013 presumably the iPhone 5S \u2013 later this year. The company showed off its new iOS 7 software at an event last week. And that might be one of the main reasons for the Best Buy deal right now.\n\"Given the tie-in of the program to purchase of an iPhone 5, their primary motivation seems to be to drive sales of new iPhones by increasing their affordability and to drive people into their stores,\" Ganot said. \"With the current timing, this may be in part a move to drive new sales in a period when consumers might  otherwise hold out on upgrading until the new iPhone is released, which is rumored to be in the fall.\"\nMore from ABC News", "Apologetic Paula Deen Let Go By Food Network After Racial Slurs Controversy\nPaula Deen visits FOX Studios, Dec. 6, 2012, in New York City.

As we wait for the royal baby, we wonder... Who's on diaper duty? What will the baby eat? What will it call the queen?  ABC News royal contributor Victoria Murphy weighs in on some of our most burning questions.\nAlpha/Landov\nWill the royal baby have pets?\n\"Definitely,\" Murphy said. \"Pets are a really big deal in the royal household. They love animals, particularly dogs and, obviously, William and Kate already have a dog.\"\nThe royal baby will join its parents' dog, Lupo, a black cocker spaniel that has been known to join the couple for walks on the beach, strolls through the woods and even on the polo field.\nMurphy said both sides of the family are \"really keen\" on animals.\n\"I think that the child will be brought up in the same way and will, I'm sure, have a really lovely relationship with little Lupo,\" she said.\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\nWill the future king or queen learn to drive?\nJudging by dad, Uncle Harry and Great-grandmum's interests ... the answer is yes.\n\"William and Harry both drive helicopters as well as cars, so I think it will be important to them that their child does all of those things as well, the normal rites of passage of growing up,\" Murphy said. \"But, of course, they will also have access to the transport that William and Kate have, chauffeurs when they need them.\"\nBoth princes have piloted helicopters as part of their service in the Royal Air Force.\nAnd who can forget Prince William's breaking tradition by famously whisking away his new bride in a convertible Aston Martin after they royal wedding? It was decorated with streamers and balloons and a \"JU5T WED\" license plate. He knows how to drive and he might very well get it from his grandmother.\nQueen Elizabeth II, 87, has often been spotted cruising around the countryside in her Range Rover after a shooting session.\nGerber or gourmet? What will the young monarch eat?\n\"I think it will have a very normal diet,\" Murphy said. \"If you look back at William's childhood, there were quite a few instances where people have talked about him liking some very un-royal things like chocolate biscuit cake, which he had at his wedding, and bacon fried in the microwave.\"\nShe predicted the royal heir will be just like any other kid that craves sweets and chocolates, but will have a health-conscious mum to stay on track.\n\"Kate, particularly, is quite keen on being healthy so I think they'll be encouraging their child to develop healthy eating habits.\"\nSee photos from throughout Kate Middleton's pregnancy.\nWill the newest heir to the throne go to school?\n\"Absolutely,\" Murphy said. \"I think that's something that will be really important to William and Kate, that they make sure they give the child as much chance as possible to have a normal upbringing and to mix with other children. I think that is something that Diana very much paved the way for with William and Harry.\"\nWilliam and Harry both went to regular (albeit elite) schools with other children in London, and their mother made a point of allowing them to enjoy normal childhood experiences like amusement parks, the movies and McDonald's.\n\"I think, even more so, Will and Kate will want it to be like that because, obviously, Kate hasn't grown up with a royal upbringing at all,\" Murphy said. \"She mingled with lots of different types of people. She went to different schools and I think it'll be really, really important to her that her children have the opportunity to do the same.\"\nTim Graham/Getty Images\nWill the royal tot have a nanny?\nMurphy believes that while a nanny is an eventual must, Kate will try to be as hands-on as possible in the early days of being a new mother.\nKate will be taking a maternity leave from her royal duties but the length of time is undecided. William will take two weeks of paternity leave, according to royal sources.\n\"She will be a full -time mum and, I think, at that stage she will do it by herself, really,\" she said. \"I think it will be later on when she starts going back into doing royal duties. And when her timetable starts up again, I think they will, at that stage, look to get some help, absolutely. And it's an incredibly important job.\"\nMurphy predicted that the royal nanny eventually entrusted to care for Baby Cambridge will be someone older, with a lot of experience, who has been recommended to the royal parents by someone trusted.\n\"I don't think that they will give someone that job based on someone just popping in for an interview,\" she said with a laugh. \"They will need to know that the person has done the work before and done it really well, and knows exactly what they're doing.\"\nPrince William formed lasting relationships with the nannies that helped raise him. He cancelled a royal commitment in order to attend the October 2012 funeral of former nanny Olga Powell, with whom he was close.\n\"He actually broke off his attendance at an engagement to attend her funeral because of the significant part that she played in his life, so I think he will want to make sure that his child has somebody who they can form a strong bond with,\" Murphy said.\nFor diaper duty, will the royals opt for traditional cloth or convenient disposable?\nPrince William was reportedly the first royal baby to use disposable diapers instead of traditional cloth diapers, and Murphy predicts the new, young parents will make the same decision.\n\"I'd be pretty sure the baby will have disposable diapers rather than the cloth ones,\" she said. \"I think it will be ordinary nappies, the ones that most people's babies use.\n\"That's a sign of the changing times,\" she added. \"I think the royal family will, like any family, adapt with the times.\"\nPrincess Diana Archive/Getty Images\nHow will we know the royal baby has arrived?\nThe first announcement from the palace will come when Kate has been admitted to the hospital, according to royal sources. It is understood that Kate will give birth in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Diana had William and Harry.\nThe formal birth announcement will come after the queen, royal family and Middletons have heard the good news, royal sources say.\nIt will follow the royal tradition of posting a paper announcement on an easel on the railing outside Buckingham Palace. The announcement will include the baby's gender, weight and time of birth. Kate and William have chosen to be surprised and do not know the sex of the baby, according to royal sources.\nThis old-fashioned announcement will be accompanied by a few more modern methods.\n\"The royal family has certain traditions that it comes back to time and time again, and I think the announcement of a new heir, I think, is going to be respected in the same way that it has been throughout history,\" Murphy said. \"But I also think they will utilize things like Twitter, social media and the website as well.\"\nPrince William was the first royal heir to be born in a hospital instead of in the palace. The first sighting of him and Prince Harry was when their parents exited the hospital with the new princes in tow. William and Kate are expected to do the same with their new arrival.\n\"I think that there will definitely be an opportunity for the baby to be photographed, assuming all is well once the couple leaves the hospital,\" Murphy said. \"I think that's the first time that we'll get to see him or her.\"\nIt's unknown when the baby's name will be revealed. Harry's name was announced the day he left the hospital, but several days passed before William's name was made public.\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\nWhat will Baby Cambridge call the queen?\nNo surprises here.\n\"As far as the queen goes, I think it will be great-grandma. That's what everyone would expect,\" Murphy said. \"That's what Peter Phillips' children, who are the queen's great-grandchildren, call her.\"\nMurphy predicted the child will use \"mummy and dad\" for Kate and William and \"grandpa or granddad and grandma\" for Prince Charles and Kate's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. No word on what step-grandma Camilla will be called.\n\"In many ways, they can be more formal but, certainly, when they're hanging out together and spending time together, it will be the usual things any family would use,\" Murphy said.\nWhat will the baby's title be?\nThe newest royal will be born with the title His or Her Royal Highness, as well as prince or princess.\nEarlier this year, the queen issued a Letters Patent, a decree method that does not require Parliament's involvement, to guarantee the title of prince or princess to all of William and Kate's future children.\nA previous decree that had been in place since 1917 said that a son would be a prince, but a daughter would not be a princess. She would be a lady.\nThis is separate from the recent British Parliament change to a 300-year-old law to allow William and Kate's firstborn, regardless of gender, to be heir to the throne. Queen Elizabeth II was only eligible to be monarch because her father had no male children.\nNo doubt the baby will also develop nicknames like its parents, Kate for Catherine and Wills for William.\n\"I think people will call it Baby Cambridge, colloquially,\" Murphy said.", "Online Ballot Disclaimer\nShare\n0\nABCNews.com posts online ballots as a way of encouraging users to express their views and participate in our community.\nThese ballots, however, are not polls.
